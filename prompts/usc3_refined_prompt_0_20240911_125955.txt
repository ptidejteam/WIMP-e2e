You are a skilled Developer tasked with generating comprehensive test cases based on the provided use case scenario.

**Objective:** Meticulously follow the given specifications and outline all possible test cases that align with the provided use case scenario.

**Instructions:** Your response should include all test cases covering normal, bounded alternative, specific alternative flows, and postconditions. 

**Structure:**

--- 
**3: Use Case: Abnormal heart rate (tachycardia), Move action is required**
**3.1 Precondition**
- BuddyApp is running
- FitbitApp is running
- Connections have been initialized

**3.2 Basic Flow**
1. The WIMP requests heart rate data from Fitbit
2. The WIMP waits until it receives heart rate data
3. The FitbitApp checks the type of requested data
4. FitbitApp validates that the requested data is heart rate data
5. The FitbitApp activates heart monitor sensor
6. The FitbitApp senses heart rate data
7. The FitbitApp sends heart rate data to WIMP
8. The WIMP receives heart rate data from Fitbit
9. The WIMP validates that heart rate is above 100
10. The WIMP sends MOVE command to Buddy with distance above 2.0 m and speed less than 0.3 m/s
11. The WIMP waits until it receives feedback from Buddy
12. The Buddy activates both wheels by setting enableWheels to TRUE
13. The Buddy moves the given distance and speaks "attention is required" when finished moving
14. The Buddy's face is set to SCARED mood
15. The BuddyApp sends execution feedback status to WIMP
16. The WIMP receives execution feedback from Buddy

**Postcondition:** 
- Buddy's face mood has changed to SCARED.
- Buddy has spoken "attention is required" and sent “WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED” status message to WIMP.

**3.3 Bounded Alternative Flow**
RFS 4-8
1. IF no heart rate data is received by WIMP THEN
2. WIMP sends SPEAK command to Buddy with "No heart rate data" message
3. ABORT
4. ENDIF

**Postcondition:**
- Buddy has spoken "No heart rate data" and sent "Speak Action Completed" back to WIMP

**3.4 Specific Alternative Flow**
RFS 9
1. IF heart rate data is not above 100 OR less than 50 bpm THEN
2. WIMP sends SPEAK command to Buddy with "No Special attention Needed" message
3. Buddy's face setMood is set to HAPPY
4. The Buddy activates both wheels by setting enableWheels to TRUE
5. Buddy rotates 180 degrees clockwise
6. Buddy speaks "No Special Attention Needed"
7. ABORT
8. ENDIF

**Postcondition:**
- Buddy's face has changed.
- Buddy has rotated 180 degrees and spoke "No Special Attention Needed".
- Buddy sent "WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED" execution status TO WIMP.

**3.5 Specific Alternative Flow**
RFS 11
1. IF WIMP receives no feedback from Buddy THEN
2. WIMP displays warning message
3. ABORT
4. ENDIF

**Postcondition:**
- WIMP displays the warning message.

**3.6 Specific Alternative Flow**
RFS 12
1. IF wheels cannot be activated THEN
2. Buddy speaks "Wheels are not enabled" message
3. ABORT
4. ENDIF

**Postcondition:**
- Buddy has spoken "Wheels are not enabled" and sent "NOK" TO WIMP.

**3.7 Specific Alternative Flow**
RFS 16
1. IF WIMP receives no execution feedback from Buddy THEN
2. WIMP displays warning message
3. ABORT
4. ENDIF

**Postcondition:**
- WIMP displays the warning message. No action is observed.

**Additional Information:**
**Inputs for Buddy action**

**1) Rotate:**
- void USB.rotateBuddy(Speed, Angle, RspCallback)
  - Purpose: rotate the robot at a given angle and speed
  - Params:
    - Speed (float): Speed of rotation in deg/s around its vertical axis, between -100°/s and 100°/s (min. absolute speed: 30°/s)
    - Angle (float, optional): Angle of rotation in degrees, between –360° and 360°
    - RspCallback (IUsbCommandRsp): Return 
      - “OK” when started
      - “WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED” when the move is finished
      - "NOK” when failed

**2) Move:**
- void USB.moveBuddy(Speed, Distance, RspCallback)
  - Purpose: Move the robot straight at a defined speed and distance
  - Params:
    - Speed (float): Speed in m/s, between 0.05m/s to 0.7m/s
    - Distance (float, optional): Distance to reach in meters
    - RspCallback (IUsbCommandRsp): Return 
      - “OK” when launched
      - “WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED” when move is finished
      - "NOK” when failed

**Condition:** You have to ENABLE WHEELS before using rotate and move functions.

**3) Enable Wheels:**
- EnableWheels
  - Left (int): Enable left wheel (0: Off, 1: On)
  - Right (int): Enable right wheel (0: Off, 1: On)
