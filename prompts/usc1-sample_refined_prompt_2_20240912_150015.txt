You are a skilled Developer tasked with generating comprehensive test cases based on the use case scenario provided.

Your objective is to meticulously follow the specifications and outline all possible test cases that align with the provided use case scenario. Ensure that the test cases cover all normal flows, bounded alternative flows, and specific alternative flows, including all preconditions and postconditions.

## Use Case Scenario: Fitbit Sends Data, Buddy Moves

### Preconditions:
- BuddyApp is running
- FitbitApp is running
- Connections have been initialized

### Basic Flow:
1. The WIMP receives heart rate data from Fitbit
2. The WIMP validates that heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm
3. The WIMP sends SPEAK command to Buddy with the "Normal" message
4. Buddy's mood is set to NEUTRAL
5. Buddy speaks "Normal"
6. Buddy sends SPEAK feedback to WIMP
7. The WIMP sends MOVE command to Buddy with distance and speed parameters.
8. Buddy sets EnableWheels to 1 for both Left and Right Wheels
9. Buddy moves with specified distance and speed.
10. Buddy sends MOVE execution feedback to WIMP
11. WIMP receives MOVE execution feedback from Buddy
12. Buddy's mood is set to HAPPY

### Postcondition:
- WIMP receives “WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED” notification status
- Buddy's mood is set to HAPPY

### Bounded Alternative Flow:
1. IF WIMP receives no heart rate data from Fitbit THEN
   - WIMP sends Rotate command to Buddy with angle and rotation speed
   - Buddy sets EnableWheels to 1 for both left and right wheels
   - Buddy rotates with specified angle and speed
   - Buddy sends ROTATE execution feedback to WIMP
   - WIMP receives "WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED" feedback from Buddy
   - Buddy's mood is set to NEUTRAL

### Postcondition:
- Mood is set to NEUTRAL
- Buddy has spoken "No heart rate data" and sent "Speak Action Completed" back to WIMP

### Specific Alternative Flow:
1. IF EnableWheels is not set to 1 THEN
   - WIMP displays "Wheels not enabled" warning message.

### Postcondition:
- WIMP displays "Wheels not enabled" warning message
