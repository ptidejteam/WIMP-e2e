### Use Case: Abnormal Heartrate (Bradycardia), Move Action Required

#### 2.1 Precondition
- BuddyApp is running
- FitbitApp is running
- Connections have been initialized

#### 2.2 Basic Flow
1. The WIMP requests heartrate data from Fitbit
2. The WIMP waits until it receives heartrate data
3. The FitbitApp checks the type of requested data
4. FitbitApp validates that the requested data is heartrate data
5. The FitbitApp activates heartmonitor sensor
6. The FitbitApp senses heartrate data
7. The FitbitApp sends heartrate data to WIMP
8. The WIMP receives heartrate data from Fitbit
9. The WIMP validates that heartrate is below 50 bpm
10. The WIMP sends MOVE command to Buddy with distance less than 2.0 m and speed less than 0.5 m/s
11. The WIMP waits until it receives feedback from Buddy
12. The Buddy activates both wheels by setting enableWheels to TRUE
13. The Buddy moves the given distance and speaks "Special attention Needed" when finished moving
14. The Buddy's face is set to mood "SURPRISED"
15. The BuddyApp sends execution feedback status to WIMP
16. The WIMP receives execution feedback from Buddy

##### Postcondition
Buddy has spoken "Special attention Needed" and sent “WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED” status message to WIMP

#### 2.3 Bounded Alternative Flow
**RFS 4-8**
1. IF no heartrate data is received by WIMP THEN
2. WIMP sends SPEAK Command to Buddy with "No heartrate data" message
3. ABORT
4. ENDIF

##### Postcondition
Buddy has spoken "No heartrate data" and sent "Speak Action Completed" back to WIMP

#### 2.4 Specific Alternative Flow
**RFS 9**
1. IF heartrate data is not below 50 or not greater than 100 bpm THEN
2. WIMP sends SPEAK command to Buddy with "No Special attention Needed" message
3. Buddy's face setMood is set to HAPPY
4. The Buddy activates both wheels by setting enableWheels to TRUE
5. Buddy rotates 90 degrees clockwise
6. ABORT
7. ENDIF

##### Postcondition
Buddy has rotated 90 degrees and spoken "No Special attention Needed". Buddy sent "WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED" execution status to WIMP.

#### 2.5 Specific Alternative Flow
**RFS 11**
1. IF WIMP receives no feedback from Buddy THEN
2. WIMP displays warning message.
3. ABORT
4. ENDIF

##### Postcondition
WIMP displays warning message. No action is observed.

#### 2.6 Specific Alternative Flow
**RFS 12**
1. IF wheels cannot be activated THEN
2. Buddy speaks "Wheels are not enabled" message
3. ABORT
4. ENDIF

##### Postcondition
Buddy has spoken "Wheels are not enabled" and sent "NOK" to WIMP.

#### 2.7 Specific Alternative Flow
**RFS 13**
1. IF MOVE cannot be completed THEN
2. Buddy speaks "Move not completed" message
3. ABORT
4. ENDIF

##### Postcondition
Buddy sends "MOVE_NOT_COMPLETED" to WIMP.

#### 2.8 Specific Alternative Flow
**RFS 16**
1. IF WIMP receives no execution feedback from Buddy THEN
2. WIMP displays warning message.
3. ABORT
4. ENDIF

##### Postcondition
No action is observed. WIMP displays a warning message.

**Additional Information**

##### Inputs for Buddy Action

1. **Rotate**
   - `void USB.rotateBuddy(Speed, Angle, RspCallback)`
     - Purpose: Rotate the robot at a given angle and speed
     - Params:
       - Speed (float): speed of the rotation in deg/s around its vertical axis, between -100°/s and 100°/s (min. absolute speed: 30°/s)
         - Speed > 0: counter-clockwise, Speed < 0: clockwise
       - Angle (float, optional): angle of the rotation in degrees, between –360° and 360°. If absent, Buddy will rotate indefinitely at the given speed
       - RspCallback (IUsbCommadRsp): returns “OK” when started, “WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED” when finished, "NOK” when failed

2. **Move**
   - `void USB.moveBuddy(Speed, Distance, RspCallback)`
     - Purpose: Move the robot straight at defined speed and distance
     - Params:
       - Speed (float): speed in m/s, (+): Forward, (-): Backward, between 0.05m/s to 0.7m/s
       - Distance (float, optional): distance to reach in meters. If absent, Buddy moves indefinitely at the given speed
       - RspCallback (IUsbCommadRsp): returns “OK” when launched, “WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED” when finished, "NOK” when failed
   
   **Condition**: Enable wheels before using rotate and move functions.

3. **Enable Wheels**
   - `EnableWheels`
     - Left (int): enable left wheel (0: Off, 1: On)
     - Right (int): enable right wheel (0: Off, 1: On)
     - RspCallback (IUsbCommadRsp): returns “OK” when launched, "NOK” when failed

4. **Speak**
   - `void Speech.startSpeaking(iText, iExpression, iCallback)`
     - Purpose: Says the provided text with special mouth movement
     - Params:
       - iText (string): Text to speak
       - iExpression (LabialExpression): Choose from SPEAK_ANGRY, NO FACE, SPEAK HAPPY, SPEAK NEUTRAL

5. **Mood**
   - `void UI.setMood(iExpression, iSpeed, IUIFaceAnimationCallback iCallback)`
     - Purpose: Give Buddy different facial expressions and set LEDs
     - Params:
       - iExpression (FacialExpression): Options like NONE, NEUTRAL, GRUMPY, HAPPY, ANGRY, LISTENING, LOVE, SAD, SCARED, SICK, SURPRISED, THINKING, TIRED
       - iSpeed (double, optional): Value from 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%), higher value makes the expression faster
       - iCallback (optional): Called at the end of instruction for success/failure

**Request**

Please provide the possible test cases based on the above use case scenario. Ensure your test cases are structured as follows:

```json
{
  "TC_ID": "TC001",
  "name": "Abnormal heartrate detected - move action required",
  "steps": [
    {
      "operation": "Request heartrate data from Fitbit",
      "target": {
        "protocol": "HTTP",
        "method": "GET",
        "name": "Fitbit"
      },
      "expectations": {
        "msg": "Successfully request heartrate data"
      }
    },
    {
      "operation": "Receive and validate heartrate data",
      "target": "FitbitApp",
      "expectations": {
        "msg": "Valid heartrate data received"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Ensure that the test cases cover all specified normal, bounded alternative, and specific alternative flows, postconditions, and other possibilities of tests in detail.
