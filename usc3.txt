Your task is to create a payload that simulates an abnormal heart rate (tachycardia) scenario where a move action is required. Use the provided use case below to craft a detailed payload that covers preconditions, basic flow, postconditions, bounded alternative flow, and specific alternative flows.

## Abnormal Heart Rate (Tachycardia) Payload Creation

### Use Case Description
- **Use Case**: Abnormal heartrate (tachycardia), Move action is required

### Preconditions
- BuddyApp is running
- FitbitApp is running
- Connections have been initialized

### Basic Flow
1. The WIMP requests heartrate data from Fitbit.
2. The WIMP waits until it receives heartrate data.
3. The FitbitApp checks the type of requested data.
4. FitbitApp validates that the requested data is heartrate data.
5. The FitbitApp activates heart monitor sensor.
6. The FitbitApp senses heartrate data.
7. The FitbitApp sends heartrate data to WIMP.
8. The WIMP receives heartrate data from Fitbit.
9. The WIMP validates that heartrate is above 100.
10. The WIMP sends MOVE command to Buddy with distance above 2.0 m and speed less than 0.3 m/s.
11. The WIMP waits until it receives feedback from Buddy.
12. The Buddy activates both wheels by setting enableWheels to TRUE.
13. The Buddy moves the given distance and speaks "attention is required" when finished moving.
14. The Buddy's face mood is set to SCARED.
15. The BuddyApp sends execution feedback status to WIMP.
16. The WIMP receives execution feedback from Buddy.

### Postcondition
- Buddy's face mood has changed, spoken "attention is required," and sent "WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED" status message to WIMP.

### Bounded Alternative Flow (RFS 4-8)
1. IF no heartrate data is received by WIMP THEN
2. WIMP sends SPEAK command to Buddy with "No heartrate data" message.
3. ABORT.
4. ENDIF.

### Postcondition
- Buddy has spoken "No heartrate data" and sent "Speak Action Completed" back to WIMP.

### Specific Alternative Flow (RFS 9)
1. IF heartrate data is not above 100 OR less than 50 bpm THEN:
2. WIMP sends SPEAK command to Buddy with "No Special attention Needed" message.
3. Buddy's face mood is set to HAPPY.
4. The Buddy activates both wheels by setting enableWheels to TRUE.
5. Buddy rotates 180 degrees clockwise.
6. Buddy speaks "No Special Attention Needed."
7. ABORT.
8. ENDIF.

### Postcondition
- Buddy's face mood has changed, rotated 180 degrees, and spoke "No Special Attention Needed." Buddy sent "WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED" execution status to WIMP.

### Specific Alternative Flow (RFS 12)
1. IF wheels cannot be activated THEN:
2. Buddy speaks "Wheels are not enabled" message.
3. ABORT.
4. ENDIF.

### Postcondition
- Buddy has spoken "Wheels are not enabled" and sent "NOK" to WIMP.
