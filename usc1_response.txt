Based on the provided use case specifications for a scenario where there is a normal heart rate and no movement action is required, here are the detailed test cases:

### Test Cases for Normal Heart Rate Scenario

#### **Test Case 1: Request Heart Rate Data**
- **Objective:** Verify that WIMP can successfully request heart rate data from Fitbit.
- **Preconditions:** BuddyApp and FitbitApp are running; connections are initialized.
- **Steps:**
  1. Invoke WIMP to request heart rate data from Fitbit.
- **Expected Result:** WIMP successfully sends a request, and there are no errors.

#### **Test Case 2: Wait For Heart Rate Data**
- **Objective:** Validate that WIMP waits until it receives heart rate data.
- **Preconditions:** WIMP has requested heart rate data.
- **Steps:**
  1. Monitor WIMP for response timeout.
- **Expected Result:** WIMP waits without errors or timeouts until heart rate data is received.

#### **Test Case 3: Check Data Type Request**
- **Objective:** Confirm that FitbitApp checks and identifies that the requested data is for heart rate.
- **Preconditions:** Heart rate request from WIMP is received by FitbitApp.
- **Steps:**
  1. Inspect the received request in FitbitApp.
- **Expected Result:** FitbitApp correctly identifies that the requested data type is heart rate.

#### **Test Case 4: Validate Heart Rate Data**
- **Objective:** Ensure that FitbitApp validates the request data type as heart rate.
- **Preconditions:** Data type has been checked by FitbitApp.
- **Steps:**
  1. Verify the validation logic in FitbitApp.
- **Expected Result:** FitbitApp confirms the request is valid and is indeed for heart rate data.

#### **Test Case 5: Activate Heart Monitor Sensor**
- **Objective:** Test that FitbitApp activates the heart monitor sensor.
- **Preconditions:** Data validation has been completed.
- **Steps:**
  1. Trigger the sensor activation in FitbitApp.
- **Expected Result:** Heart monitor sensor is successfully activated.

#### **Test Case 6: Sense Heart Rate Data**
- **Objective:** Verify that FitbitApp accurately senses and gathers heart rate data.
- **Preconditions:** Heart monitor is activated.
- **Steps:**
  1. Monitor the heart rate sensing process in FitbitApp.
- **Expected Result:** Heart rate data is gathered accurately by FitbitApp.

#### **Test Case 7: Send Heart Rate Data**
- **Objective:** Validate that FitbitApp sends correct heart rate data to WIMP.
- **Preconditions:** Heart rate data has been sensed.
- **Steps:**
  1. Check for the data transmission from FitbitApp to WIMP.
- **Expected Result:** Correct heart rate data is sent successfully from FitbitApp to WIMP.

#### **Test Case 8: Receive Heart Rate Data**
- **Objective:** Ensure WIMP correctly receives the heart rate data from FitbitApp.
- **Preconditions:** Heart rate data has been sent from FitbitApp.
- **Steps:**
  1. Monitor data reception in WIMP.
- **Expected Result:** WIMP receives the heart rate data without errors.

#### **Test Case 9: Validate Normal Heart Rate Range**
- **Objective:** Verify that WIMP correctly validates heart rate within the normal range (60-100 bpm).
- **Preconditions:** Heart rate data has been received by WIMP.
- **Steps:**
  1. Check the heart rate value against the normal range.
- **Expected Result:** The heart rate is validated to be between 60 and 100 bpm.

#### **Test Case 10: Send SPEAK Command for Normal Heart Rate**
- **Objective:** Confirm WIMP sends the SPEAK command with "Normal" message.
- **Preconditions:** Heart rate has been validated as normal.
- **Steps:**
  1. Trigger the SPEAK command in WIMP.
- **Expected Result:** SPEAK command with "Normal" message is sent to Buddy.

#### **Test Case 11: Wait for Feedback from Buddy**
- **Objective:** Validate that WIMP waits for feedback from Buddy after sending the SPEAK command.
- **Preconditions:** SPEAK command has been sent to Buddy.
- **Steps:**
  1. Monitor WIMP for feedback reception.
- **Expected Result:** WIMP waits correctly without timing out.

#### **Test Case 12: Set Buddy's Mood to NEUTRAL**
- **Objective:** Ensure Buddy's mood is set to NEUTRAL upon receipt of the SPEAK command.
- **Preconditions:** Buddy has received the SPEAK command.
- **Steps:**
  1. Check Buddy's mood state after the SPEAK command has been processed.
- **Expected Result:** Buddy's mood is set to NEUTRAL.

#### **Test Case 13: Buddy Speaks "Normal"**
- **Objective:** Verify that Buddy correctly speaks the "Normal" message.
- **Preconditions:** Buddy is set to respond to the SPEAK command.
- **Steps:**
  1. Listen for Buddy's spoken output.
- **Expected Result:** Buddy speaks "Normal".

#### **Test Case 14: Feedback from Buddy to WIMP**
- **Objective:** Confirm that BuddyApp sends feedback to WIMP after Buddy speaks.
- **Preconditions:** Buddy has spoken "Normal".
- **Steps:**
  1. Monitor feedback transmission from BuddyApp to WIMP.
- **Expected Result:** Feedback is successfully sent to WIMP.

#### **Test Case 15: Receive Feedback from Buddy**
- **Objective:** Ensure WIMP receives feedback from Buddy and processes it correctly.
- **Preconditions:** Feedback has been sent by BuddyApp.
- **Steps:**
  1. Check for feedback reception in WIMP.
- **Expected Result:** WIMP successfully receives and processes the feedback.

### Alternative Case Test Case

#### **Test Case 16: No Heart Rate Data Received**
- **Objective:** Verify that if WIMP does not receive heart rate data, it sends the SPEAK command with the "No heart rate data" message.
- **Preconditions:** WIMP has made a request for heart rate data.
- **Steps:**
  1. Simulate a scenario where no data is received.
  2. Check if WIMP sends the appropriate SPEAK command.
- **Expected Result:** WIMP sends SPEAK command with "No heart rate data" and executes the abort sequence.

#### **Postcondition for Test Case 16:**
- **Expected Result:** Buddy has spoken "No Action" and sent "Speak Action Completed" back to WIMP.

These test cases provide comprehensive coverage of the functionality described in your use case specifications for a scenario with normal heart rate and no move action required.
